## Description
The goal of this project is to establish a task manager with a spotify API component. Under each task, a user will be able to answer various questions (mood, task type, etc). Subsequently, a spotify playlist, based off the user's input, will be produced. The length of the playlists will be uninfluenced by the length of the task.
